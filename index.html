                <h3 class="col" target="_blank"> 4/5/2021</h3>
                <p>
                    Today marked the <span>beginning</span> of week 2. I guess this means that school's gonna start ramping up again, which is both exciting in that I'm closer to
                    graduating but also exhausting because we didn't get much break. This quarter, the classes I'm taking are:
                </p>
                    <ul class="rems">
                        <li>CSE 110</li>
                        <li>CSE 151b</li>
                        <li>ECE 111</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    I think this quarter's gonna go well, I feel like I got a good balance of classes and the content seems really interesting, so I'm cautiously optimistic
                    about how it'll go. My schedule's pretty great too, I'm pretty much done every day by noon, except with CSE 110 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Afterwards,
                    I worked out in my cousin's garage where he just finished his home gym setup, which is really cool to essentially have a gym to ourselves. We're currently
                    following a <b>Push-Pull</b> routine as follows:
                </p>
                    <ol class="box1">
                        <li><input type="checkbox">Pull Day 1</li>
                        <li><input type="checkbox">Push Day 1</li>
                        <li><input type="checkbox">Legs Day 1</li>
                        <li><input type="checkbox">Pull Day 2</li>
                        <li><input type="checkbox">Push Day 2</li>
                        <li><input type="checkbox">Legs Day 2</li>
                    </ol>
                <p>
                    I'm excited to start to see what goes on this quarter. I'm gonna try to continue with this workout routine as well and see the results! After my workout,
                    my girlfriend and I went to go to one of my favorite Korean wing spots around me, The Chicken on Fire. I haven't been there since before the pandemic, and I used 
                    to go there a lot with my friends from community college. The owner recognized me and my order to my surprise, and even gave us extra wings! Today was a solid
                    day, and I felt that it's a good start to this quarter.

                <p class="box2">
                    I started my day today by attending CSE 151b. It went well, just reviewing stuff from 151a, which is review that was much needed for me.
                    Then, I decided to take a quick nap but with knowing that I <strong>needed to pick up my brother at 12:15pm</strong>. Luckily, I woke up just in time and
                    went to go pick up my little brother from school, as they just resumed in person learning. After picking up my brother, we went over to my cousin's house 
                    where we worked out together. Afterwards, he cooked up some burgers and we decided to watch Zack Snyder's <i>Justice League</i>. My thoughts:
                </p>    
                    <details>
                        <summary>Spoilers</summary>
                        I've never seen the Justice League that was released originally by Joss Whedon, so I don't have too much to compare it to, but I thought
                        that this movie was pretty good. I think the DC movies should have followed a model that the Marvel movies did where they took their time 
                        and set up each character prior to joining together. Most of the movie was background for Cyborg and Flash, so they definitely did not needed
                        to make a 4 hour movie. Besides that, I thought the movie was cool, had lots of fun with it. 
                    </details>
                    After lunch, my brother and I went home and I attended my CSE 110 lecture. After lecture, I went to my girlfriend's house to hang out and play with our cat, Sol.

                <p class="box2">
                    She was a stray cat when the rescue found her, so we had to estimate that her birthday was at the end of April, but I can't believe she's already turning 1.
                    I never had a cat before, so this experience has definitely been new to me, but she's a lot of fun and a great companion for the both of us. I'm grateful for her
                    to be in my life, and am excited for when I can be with her full time.

                <p class="box">
                    Today I had ECE 111 lecture in the morning and then I had a small break before this lab was released. I played some video games in the meantime, and when the lab 
                    was released I got to work on it. This lab required us to learn some HTML, and while I was excited to learn something new, I really didn't expect to enjoy it this much.
                    I'll definitely keep working with HTML and am interested to see the things I can do once we learn a little more about CSS and Javascript. I went about halfway through this lab 
                    before taking a break to go over to my cousin's to work out. I've never really stuck to working out like this, so while I definitely feel sore I am proud of myself for not
                    giving up yet. I came back and am continuing to work on this. Recently, I've really been into the Gorillaz, especially their latest project, <i>The Song Machine</i>,
                    and they've been great studying music for me too. Here's a music video for their first single for this project and one of my favorite songs by them, "Momentary Bliss":
